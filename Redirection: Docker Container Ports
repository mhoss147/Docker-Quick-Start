# Redirection: Docker Container Ports 


Log into machine where you installed docker


- check images

docker images 


- check if any container running currently


docker container ls


- previously running container now stopped


docker container ls -a



- run NGINX image and attached 

docker container run -d nginx     (-d = attach the container)


- see history

docker image history nginx



- check the containers you have

docker container ls





- install elinks if NOT available


sudo yum install elinks



- grep (search) container with ID

docker container inspect 558... | grep IPAdd     (here 558 = CONTAINER ID) 


- elinks container

elinks 172.17...      (172... = IP from above command)

NGINX running...



- try with localhost


elinks localhost

NOT running



- try with this to solve (with CAPITAL P, random port will be matches with local port)


docker container run -d -P nginx


- run a apache server (with lowercase p we can specify what port to match with what port)

docker container run -d -p 80:80 httpd



- get the IP for that box

curl -4 icanhazip.com


- run apache server 

elinks 18.236.244.39
