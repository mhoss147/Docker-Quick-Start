    Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.[6] Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.[7] All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines.[8]

    The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.[8] It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.[9] (Credit: wikipedia)
