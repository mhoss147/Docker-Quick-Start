# The Container Lifecycle


Log into machine where you installed docker


- check images

docker images 


- check if any container running currently


docker container ls


- check if any container running previously but stopped now

docker container ls -a 


- run the container and go inside it 

docker container run -it ubuntu:16.04


- goto another terminal and check, you will find a random CONTAINER ID (it's coming from here https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/pkg/namesgenerator/names-generator.go)


docker container ls


- exit


root@69ed3c4e28f7:/# exit


- goto another terminal and check, it's not running anymore


docker container ls



- check what was running previously

docker container ls -a


- start a previously running container by using CONTAINER_ID / IMAGE  


docker container start CONTAINER_ID or IMAGE 



- check what's running 


docker container ls




- attach a container by using CONTAINER_ID / IMAGE  (you also going inside the container)


docker attach CONTAINER_ID or IMAGE 

          (Use "docker attach" to attach your terminal’s standard input, output, and error (or any combination of the three) 

          to a running container using the container’s ID or name. 

          This allows you to view its ongoing output or to control it interactively, as though the commands were running directly in your terminal.)
          
          
- exit

root@69ed3c4e28f7:/# exit


- check what is running 


docker container ls



- check what is running PREVIOUSLY



docker container ls -a
